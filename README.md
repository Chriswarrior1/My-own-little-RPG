# My-own-little-RPG
This is a rpg project of mine, created to test certain ideas and get more comfortable with coding languages, in this case C++. I plan to develop it continuously and integrate more ideas along the way.
First steps will be combat, inventory and general movement and interaction with the gaming world, as well as tools to develop items in general.
